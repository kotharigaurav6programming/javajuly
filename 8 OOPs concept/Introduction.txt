OOP's (Object Oriented Programming)
-----------------------------------
It is a way of modularizing a program which allocates partitioned memory area for both data and function and using them as a template and call the copies of such modules on demand.

class Student
|-- Data Member
     |-- int rno
     |-- double per
     |-- String name
|-- Member Function 
     |-- void getData()
     |-- void showData()		
 
OOPS Characteristics : 
----------------------
1. Emphasis is on data rather than procedure.
2. Large programs are divided into what are known as objects.
3. New Data can be added anywhere when ever required.
4. Data is hidden and cannot be accessible from outside world.
5. Follows bottom up approach.

OOPS Concept : 
--------------
1. class
2. object
3. inheritance *
4. encapsulation *
5. polymorphism *
6. abstraction *

* 4 building blocks or pillars in oops

1. class :
   a. class is a userdefined datatype for creating objects.
   b. class consists of similar type of object.
   c. class is a logical entity.
   d. class consists of data members and member functions.	 

2. object : 
   a. object is a real world entity
   b. object is also termed as run time entity
   c. every object have some physical existence thats why we can call      
      it as a physical entity
   d. every object belongs to some specific class
   e. objects may communicate with each other through functions
   f. every object have some state(data composition), identity and    
      behaviour
